		<h1>My learning style</h1>
		<h2>June 19, 2014</h2>
		<h3>
		<p>At the start of Phase 0, I took the Gregorc Thinking Styles quiz and found that I was primarily an Abstract Sequential thinker. When I starting research this type of thinking, I thought it made a lot of sense to me. As an abstract sequential thinker, I tend to work well with logic, and I try to apply theory and method to everything I do. However, I have a harder time thinking in terms of emotions, and I feel more at ease working alone than in groups.
		<p>I think I had a pretty easy time with most of the programming challenges in Phase 0. I had a lot of experience with programming and debugging, and it was pretty easy for me to pinpoint the things that confused me while learning the new languages (such as variable scope in Javascript). I do think that some of the exercises in Phase 0 are a bit too open-ended. There are some challenges where I wasn't completely sure what the desired outcome was. However, since none of the challenges were being graded, I was also comfortable setting my own goals and endpoints for each challenge. For the more vague challenges, I usually stopped working on the challenge as soon as I thought I understood everything.
		<p>So far in my dbc studies, my greatest challenges has been with blogging, especially the cultural ones. For one, it's difficult for me to write about something where there isn't one right answer, or where the lines of debate aren't completely clear. Secondly, I think I've been a bit withdrawn as far as cultural issues go. For example, I had gone through high school and college believing that gender inequality wasn't a thing anymore, and it was quite stunning to read about the discrimination that women are still faced with in the workplace.
