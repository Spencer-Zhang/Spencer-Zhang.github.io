		<h1>The Benefits of Javascript</h1>
		<h2>May 6, 2014</h2>
		<h3>There are a number of reasons that Javascript is a popular language in web development.
			<ul>
				<li><b>Javascript is supported amongst almost all browsers</b><br> Javascript has been in development for a long time, and has been used in many web sites to enable features such as frames. 
				<li><b>Javascript is relatively simple to learn.</b><br> While it does not support classes and inheritance (yet), it can simulate object-oriented programming with its Objects.
				<li><b>Javascript has access to many libraries, and can be used in conjunction with programs written in other languages, such as C++.</b>
				<li><b>Javascript operates client-side.</b><br> After a javascript program has been downloaded, most of the operations take place directly on the user's computer without any further need to communicate over the server. This reduces the load on the server, and allows for speedier responses from the program.</li>
