		<h1>Ruby's Enumerable.map method</h1>
		<h2>May 18, 2014</h2>
		<h3>
		<div class="code">Array.map{|n| perform actions here}</div>
		<p>The <b>map</b> method is a Ruby method that applies to Enumerables, which includes Arrays, Hashes, and Ranges. The map method takes each of the values in Enumerable, performs a set of procedures which are defined in a block, and returns the new values in an Array.
		<p><div class="code">[1,2,3,4].map{|n| 2*n} # => Returns [2,4,6,8]</div>
		<p>In the above example, the procedures defined within the block multiplies each of the values in the array by 2. The modified values are then put into a new array and returned.
		<p>The map method is not only used by arrays of numbers; it can also be used on arrays of strings, as in the following example:
		<p><div class="code">["apple", "spaghetti"].map{|n| n.length} # => Returns [5, 9]</div>
		<p>The <b>map</b> method is similar to the <b>inject/reduce</b> method in that it takes a range, hash, or array and performs actions based on the content of a block. However, while the <b>map</b> method returns an array, the <b>inject/reduce</b> method returns a single value. As the name of the method suggests, <b>inject/reduce</b> is used to reduce a multi-value array to a single value.
