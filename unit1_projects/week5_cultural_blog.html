		<h1>Moore's Law</h1>
		<h2>May 23, 2014</h2>
		<h3><img width="600" src="images/moores_law.jpg">
		<p>Moore's Law refers to a prediction made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the speed of computer processors will approximately double every year. From 1960 to the present day, this prediction has held true. However, the speed of computing systems does not seem to follow the same rate of growth. While processor speeds have increased over the years, the speed of computer software does not seem to have increased at the same rate.
		<p>- As processing power increases over the years, the complexity of operating systems have increased at the same rate.
		<p><img src="images/cantrun.png">
		<p>- As operating systems are updated, software written for older operating systems will lose compatibility with newer ones. In order to continue using the older legacy software, the software must be upgraded or rewritten to match the specifications of the operating system.
		<p>- As processors become more powerful, code efficiency has become less of a priority. With newer computers, programs will be able to run even if the code is not written optimally. 

		<p>In order to allow software quality to keep pace with increases in processor speed, there needs to be a greater focus on writing code that can be easily updated, and limiting the number of dependencies that each program has.
