		<h1>Moore's Law</h1>
		<h2>May 23, 2014</h2>
		<h3>

		<p>Moore's Law refers to a prediction made by Intel co-founder Gordon Moore that the speed of computer processors will approximately double every year. From 1960 to the present day, this prediction has held true. However, the speed and quality of computing systems have not followed this same rate of growth. While processor speeds have increased over the years, there are a number of factors slowing down the improvement of software.
		<p>Although computing power has increased over the years, the production of actual software is limited by the speed of people writing the code.
		<p>As processing power increases over the years, the complexity of operating systems have increased at the same rate. Every couple of years, Microsoft releases a new version of the Windows operating system which offers new features, but which also uses up more processing power, and introduces bugs into programs that had worked fine in previous versions of windows.

		<p>As operating systems are updated, software written for older operating systems will lose compatibility with newer ones. In order to continue using the older legacy software, the software must be upgraded or rewritten to match the specifications of the operating system. This means that a large amount of time is spent updating old software to current specifications rather than actually improving the software. This also means that reading old code becomes more of a priority than writing new ones.

		<p>There are a number of things that can and have been done to improve the rate of software development. First, the development of IDEs such as Visual Studio and text editors such as Sublime Text has been making it easier for programmers to write software. In order to see further improvements in software design, programmers should put more focus on making their code easy to understand and following programming practices that would make it easier to update their code in the future.
