		<h1>Pairing and feedback</h1>
		<h2>June 15, 2014</h2>
		<h3>
		<p>I've found it really helpful to pair with other people during Phase 0. I am pretty comfortable working by myself for most of the challenges, but working with another person helps me find methods and tricks that I didn't know were there before. For example, I only learned recently during a pairing that you could use for(var key in object) to get the names of all the keys in a javascript object. Before that, I managed to write working code by using indices and Object.key, but the code that I wrote during the pairing was much more compact and readable.
		<p>During pairing, I sometimes find it difficult to strike a balance between being too overbearing and doing the whole challenge myself, and sitting back and letting my partner figure things out for himself. A lot of the feedback I've received have recommended that I be more assertive during my pairing challenges, so this has helped me figure out how I should do things in future pairings.
		<p>As far as writing feedback goes, I have a hard time finding things that other people could improve on. The things that I do notice are usually programming-related, and I'm cautious about making too big of a deal if someone is inexperienced with programming. Since I spend a lot of my pairing sessions giving directions, I find it hard to give feedback on what my partner is doing.
