		<h1>Response to Shereef's Fireside Chat</h1>
		<h2>May 9, 2014</h2>
		<h3>In the video, Shereef describes two types of mentalities that a person may take towards learning. With the "<b>Table</b>" mentality, the person expects the learning to be "served" to him. With the "<b>Kitchen</b>" mentality, the person takes responsibility for his own learning. He has to come up with his own goals and objectives, and figure out what he has to do to further his own learning.
		<p>As a game designer, this makes me think of two similar types of mentalities that people take when they run into an obstacle in a game. Namely, "What does the <b>game</b> want me to do?" and "What can <b>I</b> do to get past this?" I see the first type of mentality most often when people get frustrated with a game. They become fixated on a single "solution", and blame the game if that solution doesn't work. The second mentality is much more powerful, as it encourages the player to assess all of his options and come up with solutions that the game designer may not have even thought of. This is also similar to the Growth vs Fixed Mindset that we learned about during the Prep phase. A Fixed Mindset pushes responsibility onto other people, while a Growth Mindset focuses on what you yourself can do.
		<p>Admittedly, I feel a bit less certain about what to expect from Dev Bootcamp after watching the video. Previously, I was expecting to have a list of challenges given to me, like the Ruby problems on Socrates, and have to work through these challenges within a timeframe. However, given the Kitchen mentality, I'm curious if it's more important that we create our own challenges.
