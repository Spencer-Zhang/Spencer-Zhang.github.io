		<h1>Affirmation and Stereotype Threat</h1>
		<h2>June 8, 2014</h2>
		<h3>Back in week 1, I identified my three most important values as Knowledge, Challenge, and Growth. Thinking about these values helps give me an accurate perspective on where I am right now. I think about how much more I have to learn, and how many more challenges I have to face, but I also think about how far I've come. The values also help me remember that facing frustration is a natural part of learning. If I'm having trouble with a programming problem, it doesn't mean I'm stupid. It just means I haven't learned the tricks that more experienced programmers have learned already. As soon as I've learned these techniques (and it could be as early as the very next day), I would look back at the problem and it would look perfectly plain and easy.
		<p>Whenever I'm feeling down, it helps me to fall back on my hobbies, such as drawing or playing video games. It's important for me to do something non-competitive, where I wouldn't have to compare myself to other people.
