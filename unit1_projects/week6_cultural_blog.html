		<h1>Stereotype Threat</h1>
		<h2>May 29, 2014</h2>
		<h3>Stereotype threat is theory defined by Claude M. Steele, and explains that people have a tendency to underperform when they are placed in a situation where they have a chance to confirm any negative stereotypes associated with them. In the defining experiment, Steele found that African Americans did more poorly on a test if they were told that it was a test that measured their intelligence. In test trials where they were not told this, they performed as well or better than most other test-takers.
		<p>As a Chinese American, I really don't feel like I have ever experienced stereotype threat. I mean, there's not that many negative stereotypes against Chinese people other than being nerds (and if anything, that has only encouraged me to take up the hobbies that I did while I was growing up, and right now to pursue a career in computer programming). However, I understand how anxiety and preconceptions can hurt a person's performance. 
		<p>I'm a bit reluctant to give advice on how a person can overcome this kind of anxiety. I feel like giving someone advice implies that there's an easy solution to their problem, but more often than not the solution will be difficult and frustrating. I think the bootcamp is doing a good job with the feedback system, since it is mostly anonymous and avoids comparing any one student to another.
