		<h1>SQL Injections</h1>
		<h2>June 7, 2014</h2>
		<h3>
		<p>SQL injections are a serious security vulnerability in many SQL-based web applications. SQL injections has been discussed as a security vulnerability since 1998, and still tops the list as the most serious security risk in 2013. 
		<p>Consider the following trivial SQL query that takes a user-input.
		<div class='code'>
<pre>SELECT id FROM db
WHERE user_name='&FIELD'</div>
		<p>This SQL query takes a user input from a web form and replaces &FIELD in the query with the user input. If the user enters a valid name, like "George", the query would search through the database for the name and return the id value associated with that name. However, instead of a name, a user could enter SQL code. The input would be recognized as valid SQL code rather than user input, and would cause the web server to run the SQL commands that were inputted by the user. For example, the user could enter a value of "Robert'; DROP TABLE db;--';", which would be interpretted by the server as thus.
		<div class='code'>
<pre>SELECT id FROM db
WHERE user_name='Robert'; DROP TABLE db;--';'</div>
		<p>In this example, the 'DROP TABLE db;--' written by the user is interpreted as an actual SQL command which, when performed, clears the table db. Other possible SQL injections may be used to obtain information such as usernames and passwords from an SQL database.
		<p>One way to protect your application against SQL injections is to use parameterized SQL calls. Below is an example of a parameterized SQL call written in Ruby. 
		<div class='code'>
<pre>insert_new_user = db.prepare "INSERT INTO users (name, age, 
	gender) VALUES (?, ? ,?)"
insert_new_user.execute 'aizatto', '20', 'male'
		</div>
		<p>With a parameterized SQL call, the variables are not supplied until the time of the SQL execution, so there would be no confusion between user input and SQL commands. At present, this is the most effective way to safeguard your web application against SQL injections.
