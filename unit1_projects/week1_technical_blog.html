		<h1>My favorite websites</h1>
		<h2>April 23, 2014</h2>
		<h3>The websites that I frequent the most are Youtube, Amazon, and Reddit.
			<p>The features I use most often on Youtube are the subscriptions and the search bar; I don't visit Youtube unless it's to check up on my video subscriptions or to search for a topic that I'm interested in. At one point, it was difficult to access the subscriptions page, but right now Youtube has two convenient links that go there directly from the front page. Likewise, the search bar is easily noticeable at the top of the page, and is accessible from every other page on youtube. The other easily accessible options available at the top of the screen are the settings and the Upload button, which makes it easier for users to upload their videos and add content to the site.
			<p>Like with Youtube, I don't visit Amazon.com without some objective in mind. There's either a specific item that I'm looking for (such as a specific book) or a specific category of item (such as a computer monitor). In either case, the search bar is readily accessible from all the pages, so it's easy to make a search for what I'm looking for. In the cases where I'm looking for something really vague, I use the directory on the left side of the screen, which organizes the items on Amazon into categories. Although it's easy to access the search bar and directory to find specific items that I'm looking for, the front page is designed so that the first thing someone would notice are ads for various deals. The site is designed to make it easy for people to make impulse purchases.
			<p>I usually visit Reddit to find things that are trending amongst web users. Because of the rating system, the top trending items are the ones that are shown first upon visiting the site. Once again, the search bar is readily accessible, and the tabs on the top of the screen divide the content on the site into categories.
			<p>In each of these sites, I think the common trick is using the header and sidebars to make it easy for users for find what they're looking for, and at the same time using the content areas to provide "hooks" to keep a user on the site.
