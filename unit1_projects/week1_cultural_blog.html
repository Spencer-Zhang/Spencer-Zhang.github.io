		<h1>My values</h1>
		<h2>April 24, 2014</h2>
		<h3>My most important values are Knowledge, Challenge, and Growth
			<p>Of those three, Knowledge, or Understanding, is the value that is most important to me. In the past, I've always felt the most accomplished when I'm learning something new, or when I feel like I've gained a deeper understanding of something. In programming, in drawing, and in a lot of my activities, I've had a lot of moments where I would notice a pattern in what I was doing, and that would consequently help me understand my subject better.
			<p>In general, I try to live up to those values:
			<p>* Knowledge: 	5 (Strongly Agree)
			<br>* Challenge: 	4 (Agree)
			<br>* Growth: 	4 (Agree)
			<p>The last thing someone asked me for help on is advice on how to draw. I'm not a very good artist myself, but I think I'm decent at giving critiques and feedback.
