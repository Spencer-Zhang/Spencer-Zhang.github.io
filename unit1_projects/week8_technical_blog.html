		<h1>What is Ruby on Rails?</h1>
		<h2>June 15, 2014</h2>
		<h3>Since we'll likely be using a lot of Rails in the oncoming weeks, I thought it would be a good idea to get an idea of what exactly Ruby on Rails is and what it can do.
		<p>Ruby on Rails is a framework used to develop web applications. Anything that accepts user input and changes the content of a web site based on that input is an example of a web application. If you have ever posted on an online forum, you've used a web app. Twitter is an example of a web app that lets people post status updates. Youtube is an example of a web app that lets users upload and comment on videos. There are many languages that can be used to write a web app, including PHP, Java, and Python. Most online discussion forums, for example, were written in PHP. Youtube was originally written in PHP, though it was rewritten in Java.
		<p>Recently, Ruby on Rails has been gaining popularity in the development field. Basically, it acts like an extension of Ruby. Writing code in Rails is the same as writing code in Ruby, except with more predetermined classes. Specifically, Rails includes extra objects that let a program accept user input and change the appearance of a web page.
		<p>There are many benefits to using Rails. The framework itself follows the principles of "Don't Repeat Yourself" and "Convention over Configuration". The first principle removes many of the repetitive parts of coding, which allows for speedier development. The second principle means that default behavior and parameters are set for each object and will be followed unless specified otherwise. This makes it easier to understand and edit pre-existing code, which allows for faster collaboration between teams of programmers.
